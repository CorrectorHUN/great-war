## Welcome!

The Great War was a bloody, horrible war, with countless new ways of killing, but the despite these changes, heroism didn't disappear, it even showed us our huge capability to accomodate. Let's read the forgotten stories, and be proud of our heroes together!


### Have something for us?
Most of the stories would have disappeared without the newspapers and other publishers, and some of them are still out there, waiting to be discovered and passed on. If you have a story your old great grandpa told you, or you found it in an old newspaper, send it to us via e-mail: storiesgreatwar@gmail.com
